# leaf-disease-segmentation
In this project, I performed disease segmentation on cherry, peach, and strawberry tree leaves. Since the original dataset lacked any annotations, I manually labeled a small number of images for each class and applied data augmentation techniques to increase the training data by 4â€“5 times.

For segmentation, I used the U-Net architecture as the core model. Due to the limited dataset size, I first pretrained the model on a broader dataset containing diseased leaves and then fine-tuned it on my manually annotated samples. I applied the same transfer learning strategy to train a second model that segments the entire leaf area.

Using the masks generated by these models, I calculated the total number of leaf pixels and the number of diseased pixels to determine the disease ratio. I evaluated segmentation quality based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) score and selected the best-performing weights accordingly. Finally, I overlayed the predicted masks onto the original images to provide a visual interpretation of the diseased regions.
